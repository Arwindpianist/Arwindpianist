# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arwind, a web developer and cryptocurrency enthusiast based in Malaysia. I'm currently pursuing a Diploma in ICT with a specialism in Software Engineering.

## About Me

I'm passionate about creating beautiful, functional, and innovative web designs. I love the freedom that comes with creative design and the potential for cryptocurrencies to disrupt traditional transaction methods.

## Skills & Experience

I have experience working on small-scale web development projects for local businesses, as well as developing websites for my own services and commerce. I'm well-versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks. I've also set up an AI system that keeps me updated on the latest news in the fields I'm interested in.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on Impossible Maze, which is a personal github project meant to be a fun, open-sourced game for people to enjoy. I'm excited to continue developing my skills and contributing to high-profile web development projects that push the boundaries of design and functionality.

I'm also interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. I aspire to become a provider for those who want to get started with cryptocurrencies but lack the coding knowledge to do so.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the biggest challenges I face in my web development and cryptocurrency projects is balancing creativity with practicality. However, clear communication with stakeholders and staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies have helped me find innovative solutions that meet the needs of all stakeholders involved.

## Tools & Resources

I primarily code using VSCode and use Git for version control and collaboration. I also use Codepen for collaboration and have learned a great deal from resources like W3Schools and YouTube.

## Favorite Projects

Some of my favorite projects include developing my own website for my homeserver using a Node.js framework and being one of the developers for the Wanderer Album NFT project.
